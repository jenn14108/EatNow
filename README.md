Have you ever gotten hungry all of a sudden when hanging out with your friends but cannot, for the life of you,

EatNow, a website that utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to make restaurant recommendations. I'm also aware that many apps and
websites are readily available to do such a task (such as WHERE THE F*** SHOULD I GO EAT?), but I thought that it would be cool
if I could build my own. So here it is!
